# Evaluating build scripts in the IntelliJ Rust plugin

This repository accompanies the [blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/rust/2022/10/24/evaluating-build-scripts-in-the-intellij-rust-plugin/)  in [the Rust blog](https://blog.jetbrains.com/rust/) and demonstrates several *evaluating build scripts* feature aspects including the following:

* build dependencies in `Cargo.toml`
* generating project files and configuring conditional variables in `build.rs`
* navigating to the generated files from `src/main.rs` 
* run configurations for different docker environments
